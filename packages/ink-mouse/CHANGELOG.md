### Major Changes

- 356968c: Migrate package from `@neiropacks/ink-mouse` to `@ink-tools/ink-mouse` with version 1.0.0.

  ## Breaking Changes

  - **Package renamed**: `@neiropacks/ink-mouse` → `@ink-tools/ink-mouse`
  - **Repository moved**: `neiropacks/ink-tui-kit` → `neiromaster/ink-tools`
  - **Major version bump**: 0.2.2 → 1.0.0

  ## Migration Required

  2. Update imports: `@neiropacks/ink-mouse` → `@ink-tools/ink-mouse`
  3. No API changes - all hooks, components, and utilities remain identical

  ## What's Unchanged

  - All APIs remain 100% compatible
  - All features work identically
  - Same peer dependencies (ink ^6.6.0, react ^19.2.3)
  - Same behavior and performance

  ## Documentation

  See [Migration Guide](../docs/migration-guide.md) for detailed migration instructions.

### Patch Changes

  ## What Changed

  - Added package to monorepo README

  ## What Didn't Change

  - Package name: Still `@ink-tools/xterm-mouse`
  - API: 100% backward compatible
  - All functionality preserved
  - Build output identical to standalone

  ## Testing

  - All 176 xterm-mouse tests passing
  - All 148 ink-mouse tests passing
  - Workspace dependency working correctly
  - Examples run successfully

  ## Impact

  - **For consumers:** No action required. The package works identically.
  - **For contributors:** Development now happens in the monorepo. Send PRs to the `ink-tools` repository with the `xterm-mouse` label.
